- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Abinaya-2023
- This is my first ever project. I am excited to do this.
  

Preparation phase:
-   In the preparation phase I downloaded the world happiness datasets collected by Sustainable Development Solutions Network from Kaggle.
-   I explored the data and made some hypothesis.
  

Hypothesis:
-   The happiness score may increase as the rate health, economy and social circle increase.
Data processing phase:
-   I cleaned the data and combined all the tables using SQL by JOIN functions.
-   Then I downloaded the query result.

Analyzing Phase:
-   I made calculations and sortings.
-   I did analysed the data and came to the conclusions.

Sharing phase:
-   I created data visuals using Tableau Public.
-   The Visuals represents the insights I gained from the data.
